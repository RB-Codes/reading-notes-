express()
Creates an Express application. The express() function is a top-level function exported by the express module.
This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.
Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.
A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.

Using API-based components and services in development is also a great way of maintaining scalability and productivity as it enables you to develop multiple applications based off of modular and reusable components, allowing scalability and facilitating maintenance.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs server-side. Within that environment, we can use JavaScript to build our software, our REST APIs, and invoke external services through their APIs. This fact is especially convenient for developers who are crossing over from front-end development as they should already be familiar with JavaScript, making the transition more natural. It also has the bonus of unifying all of the codebase under a single programming language.
