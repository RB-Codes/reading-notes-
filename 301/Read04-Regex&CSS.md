## Regex

Short for regular expression, a regex is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. Perl is a great example of a programming language that utilizes regular expressions. However, its only one of the many places you can find regular expressions. Regular expressions can also be used from the command line and in text editors to find text within a file.

Below is an example of a regular expression with each of its components labeled. This regular expression is also shown in the Perl programming examples shown later on this page.
