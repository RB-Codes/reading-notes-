# Responsive 

Through our work we found out that a page sometimes doesn't 
follow expected patterns and look different from the original
design, we could use the normal CSS but it was not good enough,
if something changed the page size or somebody tried to access it from another source the page would get all messed up, this is why we need responsivness, a term which means that our page is going to adhere to the opted look and it will preerve it's contents even if the device changes, and this help a lot with the huge variey we have now in the market, from laptops to smartphones etc..  


**Float**  
The CSS float property allows a developer to incorporate table-like columns in an HTML layout without the use of tables.

If it were not for the CSS float property, CSS layouts would not be possible except using absolute and relative positioning — which would be messy and would make the layout unmaintainable.

**The Clear Property in float**  
There is one more wrinkle that we have not discussed yet: the clear property. “Clear” allows elements to specify where they should align in comparison to the floated elements.


**Grid**  
Grid is like flex and float methods a way to divide the page into main parts like header and navbar and footers.

**What is SMACSS?**  

SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework. There is no library within here for you to download or install. There is no git repository for you to clone. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS. And really, who isn’t building a site with CSS these days?!
