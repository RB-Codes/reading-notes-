express()
Creates an Express application. The express() function is a top-level function exported by the express module.
This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.
Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.
A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.

Using API-based components and services in development is also a great way of maintaining scalability and productivity as it enables you to develop multiple applications based off of modular and reusable components, allowing scalability and facilitating maintenance.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs server-side. Within that environment, we can use JavaScript to build our software, our REST APIs, and invoke external services through their APIs. This fact is especially convenient for developers who are crossing over from front-end development as they should already be familiar with JavaScript, making the transition more natural. It also has the bonus of unifying all of the codebase under a single programming language.


# node with JSON 
**Working with the package.json File**  
If you look at the contents of the test directory, you‚Äôll notice a folder entitled node_modules. This is where npm has saved lodash and any libraries that lodash depends on. The node_modules folder shouldn‚Äôt be checked in to version control, and can, in fact, be re-created at any time by running npm install from within the project‚Äôs root.

If you open the package.json file, you‚Äôll see lodash listed under the dependencies field. By specifying your project‚Äôs dependencies in this way, you allow any developer anywhere to clone your project and use npm to install whatever packages it needs to run.
