# What is SQL ?


Today, Structured Query Language is the standard means of manipulating and querying data in relational databases, though with proprietary extensions among the products. The ease and ubiquity of SQL have even led the creators of many ‚ÄúNoSQL‚Äù or non-relational data stores, such as Hadoop, to adopt subsets of SQL or come up with their own SQL-like query languages.

# Journey of SQL

If you wanted to list the students enrolled in CS 101. First you would find "CS 101" in the Courses set by name, set that as the owner or parent of the Enrollees set, find the first member (ffm) of the Enrollees set, which is a Student record, and list it. Then you would go into a loop: Find next member (fnm) and list it. When fnm failed, you would exit the loop.

That may seem like a lot of scut work for the database programmer, but it was very efficient at execution time. Experts like Michael Stonebraker of the University of California at Berkeley and Ingres pointed out that doing that sort of query in a CODASYL database such as IDMS took roughly half the CPU time and less than half the memory as the same query on a relational database using SQL.
