### What is JQuery ?
It is a JavaScript file we can add to our pages it can access elements using the selectors of CSS in order to deal with them with some of the JQuery methods and example for this would be: $(li .hot), the mentioned function creates a JQuery object this one finds all the <li> with the class of (hot).

### JQuery and DOM
JQuery is similar to DOM but it uses a simpler syntax
Exactly like a DOM node you can store a JQuery object in a variable
To manipulate our selected DOM nodes we can freely use JQuery properties and methods (instead of DOMs)
There are many JQuery methods we can work with these methods are basically tasks we need to usually perform something with the element like the example:
$(‚Äòli .hot‚Äô).addClass(‚Äòcomplete‚Äô);
To update the right‚Äôs attribute we have basically used the given example it is all specified with single parameters
But there are some big differences from DOM which are
1.	It‚Äôs cross browser, and there is no need to write fallback code.
2.	It selects elements much more easily with the CSS styled syntax which are more accurate
3.	Event handling is also easier using a single method to work in all big browsers 
4.	Methods affect all targeted elements, no need to loop through each single one 
5.	There are some additional methods for desired and used tasks such as (Animation)
6.	One we select something we are free to apply multiple methods to it

### What is the matched set?
For JQuery selection you can select one of more elements a JQuery object is returned afterwards which is known as JQuery selection or the matched set, if the selector contains one item then the selector will have one reference to that one node, however when selecting multiple elements the JQuery object will have references for each of the nodes selected 
JQuery methods that can get and set data
JQuery objects store references to elements
Caching JQuery selections in variables
Checking a page is ready to work with 



### Adding JQuery to the page
We can add JQuery to the page either from the origin, from a CDN or the user‚Äôs device
